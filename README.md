## Projects

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/sean-otoole/portfolio/blob/main/images/single_cell_analysis.jpg"> **[Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis for O'Toole, 2023](https://github.com/sean-otoole/scell_otoole_2023)**

In this project, largely written in R, I used single-cell RNA sequencing data I obtained to determine the transcriptional identity of functional groups of neocortical neurons. The work involved mapping the identities of ~60k neurons through the use of dimensionality reduction, matrix factorization, clustering and bootstrapping.

This repository, written in matlab, contains two separate sets of analysis, both of which are related to examining the neural activity patterns of specific cell types. The analyses largely involved parsing a metadata file from a two-photon imaging pipeline. The level of activity for differing groups of neurons are compared during specific behavioral events. I use a combination of hierchical nested bootstrap and regression to compare these populations.

Here, with a combination of R and Python, I compare the RNA expression patterns of differing neuronal populations infected with AAVs. In the analysis I map RNA-sequencing reads against a custom version of the mouse genome (which I modfied to account for AAV expression) and compare transcriptional markers to test the specificity of populations labeled with different viruses.

In this project I compare the spatial expression of AAVs in neocortical tissue slices. Images are processed with an imagej macro and the final comparisons and computaitons are performed with python.

This code allowed for the examinae the degree to which a specific gene was knocked within and across differing cell types.<br><br>

## Micro Projects
- ### Statistics and Machine Learning
    - [Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/genetic-algorithm.ipynb) : In this file, I have implemented simple genetic algorithm that finds out the list of numbers which equal to any specified number when summed together.
    - [Bayesian Statistics](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/Bayesian%20Statistics.ipynb) : In this file, I explored how bayesian statistics works and how prior assumption reflects posterior probabilities using Gun control example. 
    - [Gaussian Mixture Model and Expectation Maximization](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/GMM-EM.ipynb): In this file, I implemented Expectation Maximization algorithm to find out true distribution of one dimensional GMM of 2 gaussians.
    - [Linear Regression](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/Linear%20Regression.ipynb): In this file, I aim to solve linear regression using analytical method and also by implementing gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and minibatch gradient descent algorithms.

- ### Ranking Algorithms
    - [Ranking of NFL teams using Markov-chain methods](https://github.com/archd3sai/Ranking-of-NFL-Teams-using-Markov-method/blob/master/Ranking%20of%20NFL%20teams%20Report.pdf) : In this project I implemented and compared three stationary distribution of Markov-chain based approaches to rank 32 NFL (National Football League) teams from "Best" to "Worst" using the scores of 2007 NFL regular season.
    - [Ranking of Tennis players](https://github.com/archd3sai/Tennis-Players-Ranking/blob/master/TennisRanking.ipynb) : Objective of this project is to rank all Tennis Players based on the matches they played in the year of 2018. This project comprises 4 approaches to rank Tennis players and I have tried to make these approaches more robust sequentially.
