## Projects

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/sean-otoole/portfolio/blob/main/images/single_cell_analysis.jpg"> **[Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis for O'Toole, 2023:](https://github.com/sean-otoole/scell_otoole_2023)**
In this project, which was primarily conducted in R, I analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data that I had collected to identify the transcriptional profiles of functional groups of neocortical neurons. The work entailed mapping the identities of approximately 60,000 neurons by employing techniques such as dimensionality reduction, matrix factorization, clustering, and bootstrapping.

This repository, developed in MATLAB, comprises two distinct sets of analyses, both aimed at investigating the neural activity patterns of specific cell types. The analyses primarily involve parsing a metadata file from a two-photon imaging pipeline. The activity levels of different neuronal groups are compared during specific behavioral events. I employ a combination of hierarchical nested bootstrap and regression analysis to compare these populations.

In this analysis, utilizing a combination of R and Python, I compare the RNA expression patterns of various neuronal populations infected with adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). I map RNA-sequencing reads to a customized version of the mouse genome, which I have modified to account for AAV expression, and analyze transcriptional markers to assess the specificity of populations labeled with different viruses.

In this project, I analyze the spatial expression of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) in neocortical tissue slices. The images are processed using an ImageJ macro, and the final comparisons and computations are conducted with Python.

This code was written to ask the degree to which specific gene is knocked down across various cell types, after AAV infection.
